On this episode, I'll be talking with some old friends. First, we have John Adams of The Super Awesome Geek show on YouTube. We discuss the controversial time travel film Confessions of a Time Traveler - The Man from 3036. And then Terry the Undisputed World's Greatest MS Paint Artist tells us a strange story of a murdered tree in Eastern Washington.
