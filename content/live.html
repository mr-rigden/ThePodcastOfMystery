The Podcast of Mystery broadcasts an open lines show to the world, live from Seattle every **Tuesday at 7pm Pacific**. 

- We want to hear about your encounters with the paranormal. Have you seen a cryptid, a UFO, a ghost, or maybe something even stranger? 
- We want to hear all about what makes you strangely unique. Are you a time traveler, do you talk to aliens, or do you have secret knowledge to share?   
- We also want to hear your options and theories about the paranormal and the news in general. Do you have an insight that others have missed or a bit of news that should get more attention?
- And Jason wants to hear your thoughts about any episode of The Podcast of Mystery!
