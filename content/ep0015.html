On this episode I'll be talking Chaz about his book "Paranormal Expeditions: Hunt for the Friendship: A story of UFOs, Nazis, Psychedelics, and an Expedition to the Edge of the World" available right now on Amazon. I absolutely loved our conversation. Chaz has a very unique perspective and style that I really appreciate.
