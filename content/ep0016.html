On this episode we have the amazing visual artist, Mark Rogers. His work is mind-blowing. 
He does these absolutely mesmerizing painting of aliens, wizards, and other strange things. 
Check out his stuff on Instagram he is [@markrogersart](https://www.instagram.com/markrogersart/). Seriously, while you are listening to this interview check out his Instagram. This was a great conversation, and I was so happy to talk to Mark. I really admire his work. Also, on this episode we also have Gary Arnold. A man who claims to be able to communicate with otherworldly entities through his $5 TracFone.
